# Doc task here later
Clone pluralsight login page - https://app.pluralsight.com/id (see video above)
Use html and pure css (not bootstrap or any other library or framework)
Download the images in this folder for use (copy and paste the svg codes below if you are having problems downloading the svg files)
Make sure the input fields, links and buttons are accessible via keyboard (i.e. focus should appear around input fields, links and buttons when you navigate the page using tab key on your computer keyboard)
Fix this: In the original pluralsight page, focus moves from the "create an account" button to "terms of use" link. It skips the tiny help button in the bottom left of the page. Make the focus appear on elements in the order that they appear on the page.
Must be responsive (exactly as it is on the original pluralsight login page)
Do it in your own github account. You are not forking or submitting as a team this time
Make sure to describe the task in your repo's readme file
Host your project on gh-pages or netlify (or any other hosting service you are comfortable using)
